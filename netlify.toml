# This file redirects Netlify to the porto subdirectory
# The actual configuration is in porto/netlify.toml
#
# IMPORTANT: You still need to set the Base directory to "porto" in Netlify UI:
# Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings > Base directory = "porto"

[build]
  base = "porto"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

# Note: This root-level config is just a pointer
# The main configuration with plugins and headers is in porto/netlify.toml
# Netlify will use the config from the base directory (porto/netlify.toml)
